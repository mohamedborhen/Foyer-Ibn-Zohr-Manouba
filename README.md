# Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/foyer-ibn-zohr.git
   cd foyer-ibn-zohr
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `foyer_db`.
   - Import the following SQL to create the necessary tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE admins (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
         password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
     );

     CREATE TABLE students (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         cin VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
         password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         contact VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
         date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
         establishment VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         room VARCHAR(50)
     );

     CREATE TABLE payments (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         student_id INT NOT NULL,
         amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
         due_date DATE NOT NULL,
         status ENUM('en attente', 'payé', 'impayé') NOT NULL,
         FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE announcements (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         content TEXT NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE requests (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         student_id INT NOT NULL,
         type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         message TEXT NOT NULL,
         status ENUM('en attente', 'traitée', 'rejetée') DEFAULT 'en attente',
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
     );
     ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Open `db_connect.php` and update the database credentials if needed:
     ```php

     $username = 'root';
     $password = '';
     ```

4. **Set Up the Web Server**:

   - Ensure the server supports PHP and MySQL.

5. **Start the Server**:
   - Launch your web server and MySQL service.
   - Access the website via `http://localhost/foyer-ibn-zohr`.

# Known Issues
- **Theme Toggle**: The dark/light theme toggle in `app.js` references undefined variables (`darkTheme`, `iconTheme`, `themeButton`), causing errors.
- **Email Functionality**: The contact form in `index.php` (public website) requires a configured mail server for email sending.
- **Session Check Files**: `check_session.php` and `check_session_admin.php` are referenced but not provided, potentially causing redirect issues.
- **Video Source**: The video in `index.php` (public website, `foyer-video.mp4`) may not load if missing or incorrectly pathed.
- **Typo in CSS Filename**: `EsapaceEtudaint.css` should be `EspaceEtudiant.css` for consistency.
- **Password Storage**: Admin and student passwords are stored in plain text, posing a security risk.
- **Admin Login Redirect**: The public website's `index.php` is replaced by the admin login, which may conflict with the public interface.

# Future Improvements
- Complete the theme toggle functionality with proper variable definitions.
- Implement a mail server (e.g., SMTP with PHPMailer) for reliable email sending.
- Add password hashing (e.g., `password_hash`) for secure storage in `admins` and `students` tables.
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms to enhance security.
- Add pagination for large datasets in the admin dashboard (students, payments, demands).
- Create a separate `index.php` for the public website to avoid conflicts with the admin login.
- Provide `check_session.php` and `check_session_admin.php` for complete session validation.
- Add input validation for admin forms (e.g., contact format, amount range).
